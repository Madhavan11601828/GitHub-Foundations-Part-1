## <center> Exercise - Try Out Git
-------------------------------------------------------------
Back to [What is Version Control?](./03_What%20is%20version%20control.md)

-------------------------------------------------------------

### Configure Git (in Local Machine)

1. Open CMD in local machine, to double-check that Git is installed, type `git --version`:

```bash
git --version
```

2. You should see output that looks something like this example:

```output
git version 2.50.1.windows.1
```

3. To configure Git, you must define some global variables: `user.name` and `user.email`. Both are required for you to make commits.
4. Set your name in CMD with the following command. Replace <USER_NAME> with the user name you want to use.

```Bash
git config --global user.name "<USER_NAME>"
```

5. Now, use this command to create a user.email configuration variable, replacing <USER_EMAIL> with your e-mail address:

```Bash
git config --global user.email "<USER_EMAIL>"
```

6. Run the following command to check that your changes worked:

```Bash
git config --list
```

7. Confirm that the output includes two lines that are similar to the following example. Your name and e-mail address will be different from what's shown in the example.

```Output
user.name=User Name
user.email=user-name@contoso.com
```

### Set up your Git repository

Git works by checking for changes to files within a certain folder. We'll create a folder to serve as our working tree (project directory) and let Git know about it, so it can start tracking changes. We tell Git to start tracking changes by initializing a Git repository into that folder.

Start by creating an empty folder for your project, and then initialize a Git repository inside it.

1. Create a folder named `GitHub Foundations Part-1`. This folder will be the `project directory`, also called the `working tree`. The project directory is where all files related to your project are stored. In this exercise, it's where your learning files and its contents are stored.

```Bash
mkdir "GitHub Foundations Part-1"
```

2. Change to the project directory by using the `cd` command:

```Bash
cd "GitHub Foundations Part-1"
```

3. Now, initialize your new repository and set the name of the default branch to main:
If you're running Git version 2.28.0 or later, use the following command:

```Bash
git init --initial-branch=main
```

Or use the following command:

```Bash
git init -b main
```

For earlier versions of Git, use these commands:

```Bash
git init
git checkout -b main
```
After you run the initialize command, you should see output that's similar to this example:

```Output
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Venu/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub_Self Study Material/GitHub Foundations Part-1/.git/
Switched to a new branch 'main'
```

4. Now, use a `git status` command to show the status of the working tree:

```Bash
git status
```
Git responds with this output, which indicates that main is the current branch. (It's also the only branch.) So far, so good.

`<u>Note:</u> I have a few .md files already in the Project Directory.`

```Output
No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        01_Introduction to Git.md
        02_Introduction.md
        03_What is version control.md
        04_Exercise_Try Out Git.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

5. Use an ls command to show the contents of the working tree:

```Bash
ls -a
```
Confirm that the directory contains a subdirectory named .git. (Using the -a option with ls is important because Linux normally hides file and directory names that start with a period.) This folder is the Git repositoryâ€”the directory in which Git stores metadata and history for the working tree.

You typically don't do anything with the .git directory directly. Git updates the metadata there as the status of the working tree changes to keep track of what's changed in your files. This directory is hands-off for you, but it's incredibly important to Git.

### Get help from Git

Git, like most command-line tools, has a built-in help function that you can use to look up commands and keywords.

1. Type the following command to get help with what you can do with Git:

```Bash
git --help
```

2. The command displays the following output:

```Output
usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--no-lazy-fetch]
           [--no-optional-locks] [--no-advice] [--bare] [--git-dir=<path>]
           [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone      Clone a repository into a new directory
   init       Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add        Add file contents to the index
   mv         Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore    Restore working tree files
   rm         Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect     Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff       Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep       Print lines matching a pattern
   log        Show commit logs
   show       Show various types of objects
   status     Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   backfill   Download missing objects in a partial clone
   branch     List, create, or delete branches
   commit     Record changes to the repository
   merge      Join two or more development histories together
   rebase     Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset      Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch     Switch branches
   tag        Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch      Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull       Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push       Update remote refs along with associated objects

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
See 'git help git' for an overview of the system.
```
Read through the different options available with Git and note that each command comes with its own help page, for when you start digging deeper. Not all these commands will make sense yet, but some might look familiar if you have experience using a VCS.
