[Introduction To Git](./01_Introduction%20to%20Git.md)

Imagine you're a new software developer at a firm that writes avionics software for commercial airliners. `Quality control is critical, and developers work in small teams using Git for version control`.

In this module, you'll get an introduction to version control, and Git. Git can seem a little cryptic at first, and it can even be frustrating at times. But if you learn it step by step, you'll find that there's a reason Git is quickly becoming the world's most popular version control systemâ€”not just for software developers, but also for teams that write documentation and collaborate on other work.
